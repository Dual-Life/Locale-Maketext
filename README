			   Locale::Maketext

!!!! THIS IS AN UNDER-DOCUMENTED ALPHA RELEASE !!!!

Locale::Maketext is a base class providing a framework for software
localization and inheritance-based lexicons, as described in my
article in The Perl Journal #13 (which is on the way to your mailbox
and/or newsstand).

I rushed this out without proper documentation and examples, and have
just never gotten around to documenting it.  I really really really
want to fix this, but just need to find a free afternoon (i.e., one
not otherwise consumed by more writing for TPJ, trying to patch bugs
in HTML-Tree, or, you know, my macrame) to fix it.


PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5.  It also requires a recent version
of I18N::LangTags.


INSTALLATION

You install Locale::Maketext, as you would install any Perl module
distribution, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of Maketext in your home directory,
then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with something
like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl


DOCUMENTATION

See the pods in Locale::Maketext.


SUPPORT

Questions, bug reports, useful code bits, and suggestions for
Worms should be sent to me at sburke@cpan.org


AVAILABILITY

The latest version of Locale::Maketext is available from the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).  Visit
<http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to find a CPAN site near you.
